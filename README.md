# Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes public tweets to classify sentiment as **Positive, Neutral, or Negative** using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Social media platforms generate large volumes of unstructured text data. Understanding public sentiment from tweets can help organizations analyze opinions, trends, and user behavior.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TextBlob, VADER, NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- MongoDB
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
- 100,000+ tweets collected and stored in MongoDB
- Data cleaning included tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Sentiment scoring using NLP techniques  
3. Feature extraction  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
5. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Results
- Achieved **~90% sentiment classification accuracy**
- Logistic Regression performed well on balanced datasets
- Random Forest improved robustness on noisy data

## Visualizations
- Sentiment distribution
- Confusion matrix
- Model comparison

## Future Improvements
- Real-time Twitter API integration
- Deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Dashboard for sentiment trends
